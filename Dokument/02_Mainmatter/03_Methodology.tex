\chapter{Methodology}\label{chap:Methodology}
To address the challenges identified in~\autoref{chap:Related Work}, namely 
evaluation-speed and categorization of near-classes, recent advances in machine 
learning are considered. Contrary to most approaches in the field which perform 
segmentation, our work focuses on detecting bounding boxes. In this chapter, 
detail on the applied methods is provided.
The methods are grouped as one-staged or two-staged approaches.
