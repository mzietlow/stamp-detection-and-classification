Also, they usually don't deal with classification except for stamp - nonstamp

The proposed method for removal of gray stamps is is described in this section
In our approach
What is the enemy, why is our approach needed?
Evidently, all the published methods have considerable limitations...





Briefly describe what is going to happen in this chapter, explain the chapter 
flow. Talk about goals (classification), mention bounding boxes and spoil onto 
the our own dataset (black/white, bounding boxed labels). Don't forget labels
are faulty.\\

\section{Advanced concepts of bounding box encoding}
Bounding boxes are something (kind of) novel for this research group. They 
usually aimed at directly segmenting the stamps, by applying masks etc.


\section{Preprocessing}
Brifely and mathematically describe the executed steps and their motivation.
Make notes for the `further research'-sub-section.

\section{Object Detection Frameworks}
Why combine localization and classification, why not split both? Is it speed 
only?
