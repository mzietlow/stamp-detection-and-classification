Goals: 
    a.) How good can stamp detection get with current frameworks
    b.) How good can classification of a vast variety of similar classes get
        with current frameworks

\section{Metrics}
Although used in almost all related \todo{literature or writings} metrics such 
as precision and recall are 
\subsection{Confidence Score} is a measure of whether an image contains a 
certain class, assigned by a classification layer. \todo{crossreference softmax}
