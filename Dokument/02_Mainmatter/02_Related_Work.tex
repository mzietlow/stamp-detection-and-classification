\section{Related Work}\label{sect:related-work}
In the past, a variety of methods for stamp detection has been proposed.
One patent on stamp detection, for example, dates back as far as
1963~\cite{Steinbuch.1963}.

A typical strategy found in most publications is to first separate a set of
stamp-candidates from text and background, followed by a \textit{verification} of those
candidates by applying thresholds on multiple previously chosen features.

To provide an overview of the topic, recent work on stamp detection is split into
two major- and respective sub-categories in the following.

{\bfseries{}Restricted Approaches}
    \begin{description}[font={\color{red!50!black}\ttfamily}]
        \item[Color restricted]
                \Textcite{Micenkova.2011} present an approach based on color
                clustering and geometric features. To extract a set of
                stamp-candidates from a given image, they assume stamps to
                be chromatic objects. In consequence, all achromatic parts
                are dropped off the image. To separate the remaining candidates
                for individual analysis, the XY-Cut algorithm proposed
                in~\cite{Krishnamoorthy.1993} is applied. For classification,
                an ensemble of geometric- (pixel density, skew, etc.) and
                color-related features (standard deviation of hue) is compared
                with empirically set thresholds. By treating stamps as
                chromatic objects, they are unable to detect black stamps
                and face problems when colored fonts are used.                
                In~\cite{Micenkova.2015}, \citeauthor*{Micenkova.2015} improve
                upon this method by applying additional geometric features.
                
                A predecessor of the approach by \textcite{Micenkova.2011}
                is~\cite{Forczmanski.2010} which uses fewer features for
                \textit{verification} and is only applicable to blue or red
                colored stamps.
            \item[Geometrically restricted]
                An early attempt of using geometric analysis was formulated by
                \textcite{Zhu.2006}, proposing an ellipse detection algorithm
                inspired by Hough transform~\cite{Duda.1972}. However, this method
                is only applicable to elliptical stamps.

{\bfseries{}Generic Approaches}
\begin{description}[font={\color{red!50!black}\ttfamily}]
    \item[Geometric features]
    A more versatile method than~\cite{Zhu.2006} was proposed in
    \cite{Ahmed.2013, Ahmed.2016}.
    \citeauthor*{Ahmed.2013} make use of advances in research of \textit{feature detectors}
    and \textit{feature descriptors}. In a first step, the image is
    binarized~\cite{Tensmeyer.2020} and connected components are extracted.
    For every connected component, \textit{feature key points} and \textit{feature descriptors}
    are computed via FAST~\cite{Rosten.2005} and ORB~\cite{Rublee.2011}.
    Further, \gls{bbox} height and width of each connected component
    are extracted. \textit{Verification} is performed by comparing the extracted
    features of each connected component to a validation set~\cite[120\psq]{Goodfellow.2016}.
    However, the authors notice low precision- and recall-rates, caused by their inability
    to recognize severely overlapping stamps.

    In~\cite{Nandedkar.2015b}, \citeauthor*{Nandedkar.2015b} extend an approach
    they suggested earlier in~\cite{Nandedkar.2015}. They analyze spatial
    frequency components in document images, finding text to be the major
    contributor. To segment a given image, they first conceal
    text-components by removing objects with high spatial frequencies and
    further apply a Gaussian filter. To prevent textual stamps from being
    removed, a chromaticity threshold is applied on the removal of spatial
    frequency components. Stamp-candidates are then identified using mean-shift
    segmentation~\cite{Fukunaga.1975}. Small regions are filtered
    with an empirically set threshold, where the largest region is considered
    to be the background. For \textit{verification} of stamp-candidates,
    AlexNet~\cite{Krizhevsky.2012} is used, producing three classes
    (logo, stamp and noise) in the final \gls{dense layer}. Even though unmentioned
    in the paper, the presented approach of filtering spatial frequency
    components faces limitations regarding black textual stamps which might
    turn out to be removed by the spatial frequency filter.
    \item[Mixed features]
    \citeauthor*{Dey.2015} propose an outlier-based
    method in~\cite{Dey.2015}. To segment a given image,
    it is separated in foreground and background using binarization~\cite{Tensmeyer.2020}.
    To retain color information the obtained foreground-values are applied as
    a mask to the original image. Color information is reduced from
    three-dimensional \textit{RGB} color space to a one-dimensional principal
    component using \gls{pca}~\cite{Hotelling.1933}.
    Stamp-candidates are obtained using a connected-components algorithm on
    the first principal component (from \gls{pca}). To filter out \glspl{fp},
    thresholds on features such as stroke width, \gls{bbox} width and
    height are applied. For \textit{verification}, a set of features is extracted and
    validated using additional empirically set thresholds.

    A sliding window approach using the AdaBoost~\cite{Freund.1995} on cascaded
    decision trees has been proposed in~\cite{Forczmanski.2016}. To train 
    AdaBoost, a labeled training set is constructed. For each training 
    sample, Haar-like features~\cite{Viola.2001} are extracted. AdaBoost then
    constructs a set of consecutive decision trees to optimize stamp classification
    of training samples. Each decision tree takes in a Haar-like feature from 
    a fixed position inside the sliding window. Based on the input feature 
    value, the tree decides whether to \textit{accept} or \textit{reject} a
    given window as stamp-candidate. A set of consecutive decision trees
    with such property (\textit{accept} or \textit{completely reject}) is
    then called a \textit{cascade}. In order for a sliding window to become a valid
    stamp-candidate it has to survive such a cascade of decision trees. The
    set of generated candidates is then \textit{verified} using a broader set of features.
    Several algorithms are compared for \textit{verification} including neural
    networks, decision trees, and \glspl{svm}.

    \textcite{Younas.2017} propose using a \gls{fcn}, built upon the VGG-16~\cite{Simonyan.2015}
    network architecture. In this approach, the final \glspl{dense layer}
    of VGG-16 are replaced with a \gls{deconvolutional layer}. By doing this,
    a prediction map is received as output instead of classification scores.
    To reduce training time, transfer learning from the \gls{voc}2011 dataset is
    applied (although without ablation study of the impact of transfer learning).
    However, no preprocessing is mentioned. Using 90\% of their dataset for
    training and 10\% for \textit{verification} they report ``state-of-the-art''
    results, although noticing difficulties with tabular stamps.
\end{description}

Despite numerous research carried out on stamp segmentation, most of the 
approaches examined in this chapter either face limitations with overlapping 
objects~\cite{Nandedkar.2015, Nandedkar.2015b,Forczmanski.2016, Ahmed.2013, Dey.2015, 
Forczmanski.2015, Forczmanski.2016} or logo misclassification~\cite{Ahmed.2013,Dey.2015,Micenkova.2011}.
Some approaches are limited by runtime, operating for more than 13 Seconds per
evaluation~\cite{Ahmed.2016,Nandedkar.2015}.
\par
Besides segmentation, classification of stamps is observed to be a common task 
in literature. Classes are usually either binary (Stamp and non-Stamp), 
object-related (Stamp, Logo, Text, Tables)~\cite{Forczmanski.2016,
Nandedkar.2015, Nandedkar.2015b, Dey.2015},
or shape-dependent (Circle, Ellipse, Square, etc.)~\cite{Forczmanski.2015}.
However, research on classification of similar stamps i.e.\ stamps belonging to
the same shape-class but differing in text and decor, has so far only been
reported on by~\cite{Petej.2013}.
