    In this paper, the well-known SSD framework~\cite{Liu.2016} for object detection
    is thoroughly introduced. For many of its building blocks, motivations are
    provided that were omitted in its original formulation. The framework is
    implemented, using MobileNetV1 as its base network without pre-training. The
    model is then applied to a well known public data set for stamp detection
    (\acrshort{staver}). As a metric, \gls{map} is reported and visual examples
    of prediction results are discussed. The method produced generally favorable
    results and was able to overcome most of the flaws reported by related work.
