@article{Boross.2013,
 abstract = {Spintronics is an emerging paradigm with the aim to replace conventional electronics by using electron spins as information carriers. Its utility relies on the magnitude of the spin-relaxation, which is dominated by spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Yet, SOC induced spin-relaxation in metals and semiconductors is discussed for the seemingly orthogonal cases when inversion symmetry is retained or broken by the so-called Elliott-Yafet and D'yakonov-Perel' spin-relaxation mechanisms, respectively. We unify the two theories on general grounds for a generic two-band system containing intra- and inter-band SOC. While the previously known limiting cases are recovered, we also identify parameter domains when a crossover occurs between them, i.e. when an inversion symmetry broken state evolves from a D'yakonov-Perel' to an Elliott-Yafet type of spin-relaxation and conversely for a state with inversional symmetry. This provides an ultimate link between the two mechanisms of spin-relaxation.},

The optical and electronic properties of semiconductors, particularly semiconductor quantum-well systems, are analyzed in detail, covering a wide variety of near-infrared systems with or without strain, as well as wide-gap materials such as the group-III nitride compounds or the II-VI materials. The important bandstructure modifications and Coulomb interaction effects are discussed, including the solution of the longstanding semiconductor laser lineshape problem. Quantitative comparisons between measured and predicted gain/absorption and refractive index spectra for a wide variety of semiconductor-laser materials enable the theoretical results to be used directly in the engineering of advanced laser and amplifier structures. A walth of examples for many different material combinations bestow the book with quantitative and predictive value for a wide variety of applications},

 abstract = {The design of cost-effective standards for the quality of nano-objects is currently a key issue toward their massive use for optoelectronic applications. The observation by photoluminescence of narrow excitonic and biexcitonic emission lines in semiconductor nanowires is usually accepted as evidence for high structural quality. Here, we perform time-resolved cathodoluminescence experiments on isolated ZnO nanobelts grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observe narrow emission lines at low temperature, together with a clear biexciton line. Still, drastic alterations in both the CL intensity and lifetime are observed locally along the nano-object. We attribute these to non-radiative recombinations at edge dislocations, closing basal plane stacking faults, inhomogeneously distributed along the NB length. This leads us to the conclusion that the observation of narrow excitonic and biexcitonic emission lines is far from sufficient to grade the quality of a nano-object.},

@article{Duan.2003,
 abstract = {Electrically driven semiconductor lasers are used in technologies ranging from telecommunications and information storage to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. The success of this class of lasers is due in part to well-developed planar semiconductor growth and processing, which enables reproducible fabrication of integrated, electrically driven devices. Yet this approach to device fabrication is also costly and difficult to integrate directly with other technologies such as silicon microelectronics. To overcome these issues for future applications, there has been considerable interest in using organic molecules, polymers, and inorganic nanostructures for lasers, because these materials can be fashioned into devices by chemical processing. Indeed, amplified stimulated emission and lasing have been reported for optically pumped organic systems and, more recently, inorganic nanocrystals and nanowires. However, electrically driven lasing, which is required in most applications, has met with several difficulties in organic systems, and has not been addressed for assembled nanocrystals or nanowires. Here we investigate the feasibility of achieving electrically driven lasing from individual nanowires. Optical and electrical measurements made on single-crystal cadmium sulphide nanowires show that these structures can function as Fabry-Perot optical cavities with mode spacing inversely related to the nanowire length. Investigations of optical and electrical pumping further indicate a threshold for lasing as characterized by optical modes with instrument-limited linewidths. Electrically driven nanowire lasers, which might be assembled in arrays capable of emitting a wide range of colours, could improve existing applications and suggest new opportunities.},

@article{Dvorak.2013,
 abstract = {Excitonic effects are crucial to optical properties, and the exciton binding energy E(b) in technologically important semiconductors varies from merely a few meV to about 100 meV. This large variation, however, is not well understood. We investigate the relationship between the electronic band structures and exciton binding energies in semiconductors, employing first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory and the many-body perturbation theory using Green's functions. Our results clearly show that E(b) increases as the localization of valence electrons increases due to the reduced electronic screening. Furthermore, E(b) increases in ionic semiconductors such as ZnO because, contrary to the simple two-level coupling model, it has both conduction and valence band edge states strongly localized on anion sites, leading to an enhanced electron-hole interaction. These trends are quantized by electronic structures obtained from the density functional theory; thus, our approach can be applied to understand the excitonic effects in complex semiconducting materials.},

 abstract = {The synthesis of CdS nanostructures (bands, wires, irregular structures) was investigated by systematic variation of temperature and gas pressure, to deduce a comprehensive growth phase diagram. The high quality nanowires were further investigated and show stoichiometric composition of CdS as well as a single-crystalline lattice without any evidence of extended defects. The luminescence of individual nanowires at low excitation shows a strong near band edge emission at 2.41 eV indicating a low point defect concentration. Sharp peaks evolve at higher laser power and finally dominate the luminescence spectrum. The power dependence of the spectrum clearly shows all the characteristics of amplified stimulated emission and lasing action in the nanowire cavity. A low threshold was determined as 10 kW cm(-2) for lasing at room temperature with a slope efficiency of 5-10{\%} and a Q factor of up to 1200. The length and diameter relations necessary for lasing of individual nanowires was investigated.},

@article{Haranath.2009,
 abstract = {We report a simple method for the synthesis of Na(+) doped and stable zinc oxide quantum dots, using the quantum confinement atom method. An intense broad green photoluminescence (PL) was observed with a maximum located at approximately 535 nm when excited by UV radiation of 332 nm. The PL peak intensity is found to be highly dependent on the size of the quantum dots (QDs). Electron microscopy observation revealed that the radius of the QD was approximately 1 nm, which clearly indicated that the QDs are in the strong quantum confinement region (exciton Bohr radius, r(B), for bulk ZnO is 1.8 nm). Phase purity of ZnO and the presence of Na(+) was confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), respectively. The results are well incremented by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. Intentional ageing of QDs for several days under controlled experimental conditions such as temperature, relative humidity and pH etc, facilitated the formation of various nanostructures with a slight red shift in the PL peak position. Time resolved emission spectroscopy measurements indicated that PL decay time changes from 35 ns for QDs to 1660 micros for nanocrystals. The observed high-intensity and stable green PL emissions have been analyzed and thoroughly discussed.},

@phdthesis{Richters.Diss,
 abstract = {ZnO nanowires, surface treatment, surface exciton, hydrogen doping, electron-hole-plasma, lasing, modal gain. - ZnO nanowires are promising building blocks for optoelectronic applications. Lasers and light-emitting diodes fabricated from ZnO nanowires will emit in the blue and near-UV spectral region due to the wide band gap of ZnO. Their large refractive index makes them useful as active waveguides in optoelectronic devices. In addition to the near UV emission, ZnO can show several defect related emission bands in the visible spectral region. By carefully doping the material, these defect bands can be tailored to generate a white-light spectrum which will be beneficial for applications as light emitting diodes. Much research interest focused on the various defect bands in the past years. Previous work of the author on ZnO nanowires embedded in polymer matrices shows a strong decrease of the defect luminescence for the embedded samples, combined with a stronger surface exciton emission band. In this work, the dependence of the defect and near-band-edge luminescence of ZnO nanowires on surrounding materials necessary to fabricate nanowire-LED devices is investigated. First, coating of the nanowires with a dielectric shell of amorphous Al2O3 is found to strongly suppress the defect luminescence while enhancing the surface excitonic emission. This effect is similar to the previously investigated polymer samples and is explained by a model based on the dielectric properties of the material. A dielectric coating shields the surface states and reduces the band bending typically observed for the ZnO nanowire surfaces. The band bending influences the activation mechanism of deep centers which cause the defect luminescence and redistributes the excitons near the surface in favour of the surface excitonic recombination mechanism. As a next step, the influence of metallic coatings on the optical properties of ZnO nanowires is investigated and found to result in an opposite behaviour compared to the dielectric coating. An increased defect luminescence and a reduced surface emission band are observed, completely independent of the work function of the metal. These findings are explained by the format on of metal-induced gap states at the nanowire surface, which trap excitons close to the surface. The interaction between plasmonic resonances of metal nanoparticles and excited states of semiconductors has attracted much attention in the research community. The use of a plasma sputter-coater is one method to deposit such metal nanoparticles. In this work, experimental evidence is presented which shows that the plasma of such a system itself changes the optical properties of ZnO nanowires by implantation of hydrogen into the crystal. The defect luminescence is weakened while the near-UV emission is enhanced, but does not show a stronger surface excitonic emission. The lifetime of the charge carriers excited by a fs laser is investigated in pump-and-probe experiments on ZnO bulk surfaces. Even at excitation densities below the lasing threshold, an electron-hole-plasma forms with lifetimes of several tens of picoseconds. In order to investigate the lasing properties of single ZnO nanowires, a setup based on the variable-stripe-length method is developed and used to determine the modal gain of single nanowires. When exciting with a fs laser, modal gain values of up to 4900 cm$-$1 are found which are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The gain is found to depend on the nanowire diameter.},

 abstract = {Coherent light sources confining the light below the vacuum wavelength barrier will drive future concepts of nanosensing, nanospectroscopy, and photonic circuits. Here, we directly image the angular emission of such a light source based on single semiconductor nanowire lasers. It is confirmed that the lasing switches from the fundamental mode in a thin ZnO nanowire to an admixture of several transverse modes in thicker nanowires approximately at the multimode cutoff. The mode competition with higher order modes substantially slows down the laser dynamics. We show that efficient photonic mode filtering in tapered nanowires selects the desired fundamental mode for lasing with improved performance including power, efficiency, and directionality important for an optimal coupling between adjacent nanophotonic waveguides.},

Normally they reduce device efficiency by suppressing luminescence, creating defects, reducing carrier lifetimes, or enhancing diffusion during operation. The present review surveys both the theoretical and practical understanding of non-radiative transitions. It includes general theoretical results and the associated ideas, with the emphasis on phonon-induced and defect Auger processes. Most of the purely formal aspects are omitted, but the points of principle where uncertainties remain are discussed. The review also covers the relation between basic theoretical studies and practical applied work on device degradation. This includes a description of the atomic processes involved in the more important mechanism of device deterioration and the theoretical understanding of the mechanism of these underlying processes. Finally, there is a survey of models proposed for 'killer' centres.},
